- 👋 Hi, I’m Sourav Bera, a Research Scholar at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, India.
- 👀 I’m interested in the Phenomenology of Heavy Ion Collisions which aims at understanding Quantum Chromodynamics. I also take keen interest in Particle Physics and Cosmology.
- 🌱 I’ve built physically driven dynamic models, namely, Monte-Carlo Glauber Model and Ideal Relativistic Hydrodynamics(using FCT-SHASTA, HLLE and KT) to probe the Physics of Heavy Ion Collisions. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos through the language of physics.
